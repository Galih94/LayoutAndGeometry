# LayoutAndGeometry  
This is a basic learning technique project diving deep into how SwiftUI handles layout. It explores the fundamental mechanics of SwiftUI's layout system, covering topics such as alignment, spacing, and size calculations. The project also delves into advanced layout techniques, including the use of GeometryReader for creating special effects and custom alignments.

The source learning is from the 18th project of the course "100 Days of SwiftUI" (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
